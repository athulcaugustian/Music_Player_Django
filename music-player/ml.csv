Hindi Album,6,"He Didn’t Even Touched Me,
Nothing Happened Between Us
Eyes Were Sharp, There Was Restlessness
Something Happened When Our Eyes Met
When My Loved One Saw Me,
I Started Blushing, Oh My Dear
I Started Blushing
I Started Blushing
Hey Girl, Will You Go With Me
Will You Fill The Glass Having In My Hand, As It Empty
Will You Be Afraid Of The Boy, Who Comes Along With Me?
Will You Fight With The Inner Feeling?
The Limit Has Been Exceeded
Hey Girl, Will You Go Beyond The Limit?
Farm In 9 Acres, Horses In The Farm
Hey Girl, Will You Ride The Horse
1-2-3, Angels Came Out From The Bonnet Of The Car
No One (Boy) Can Stand In Front Of You
My Words Are Crooked, Write It Somewhere
Let’s Go Somewhere
I Am Lost, Like Never Before
The Time When My Eyes Met With Your Eyes, I Haven’t Even Slept
I Have Heard About You From The World
Don’t Know What Will Come In My Part
I Became Addicted To This Thought
When My Loved One Saw Me,
Oh My Dear, I Started Blushing
I Started Blushing
My Status Is Not Good, I Do Wrong Deed
Every Week My Name Appeaers In The News
From Wherever I Pass,
Screams Cames Out From Each Girl
Hold My Hands But Don’t Try To Love Me
What You Say Just Do It
Heard Somewhere,
That You Have Feelings For Me
If Yes, Just Confess It
Just Leave It, Don’t Try To Say Anything
Let The Eyes Say What They Want To Say
Today You Worked So Hard,
Lets Flow All That Like The Water
Eyes Were Sharp, There Was Restlessness
Something Happened When Our Eyes Me
When My Loved One Saw Like That."
Hindi Album,7,"O' O' I saw you
Laughter on your cheeks
Deep in thought
In mentions of beauty
In the hair of Sohni (Sohni is equivalent of Juliet in Punjab, India)
In the way a peacock walks
In earthen ware bowls
In bronze flatware
The more I get you, the more you feel mine
Whenever you stretch, come see me
Even the heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
The rainy seasons of childhood have passed, the time of teenage years is past
I turned and looked behind, I lost all my earlier life
Even then I held on your hope, passed each day
Your one look towards me, helps me breathe
I make a request to you not to break my heart
Even the heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
 
My two intoxicating eyes, are only looking waiting for you O' love
To quench the thirst of my love, set my body as a wedding stage
What are you thinking, I am already lost
Again again on every branch every limb, every direction I await you
Even the heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
The heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
 
O' O' I saw you
In the soft light of the morning dawn
In streams and in brooks
In moments and in years
In the lovers who love
In those with zeal and those with zest
In the anguish of love
In living examples
The more I get you, the more you feel mine
The thread of life, I have attached with my beloved
The heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful
The heart twirls twirls, twirls twirls O beautiful O beautiful"
Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na,8,"Sometimes Aditi
In life someone feels like our own
Sometimes Aditi
It feels like a dream when they go away
In such a situation
How can one stop their tears
And how can one think that
Everything's gonna be okay
Sometimes it feels like
There is no joy or fun left in life
Sometimes it feels like
Every day and moment is a punishment
In such a situation
How can one smile and laugh in happiness
And how can one think that
Everything's gonna be okay
Think about it, my beloved
How much I love you
I also cry
When there are tears in your eyes
I don't know how to sing
But still I sing
Hey Aditi understand that at times
There is darkness in the entire world
But only after night
Comes a morning
Sometimes Aditi
In life someone feels like our own
Sometimes Aditi
It feels like a dream when they go away
Hey Aditi laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Laugh a little
Or else just a bit, bit, bit, bit
Smile a bit
If you're happy then it feels like
There is happiness spread in the world
The sun comes out from the clouds
And distributes life
Listen what this intoxicated breeze
Is telling you
That Aditi those who separate
Someday they do unite again
Aditi whether you know this or not
The flowers do bloom someday again
Sometimes Aditi
In life someone feels like our own
Sometimes Aditi
It feels like a dream when they go away
Hey Aditi laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Laugh a little
Or else just a bit, bit, bit, bit
Smile a bit
Hey Aditi laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Laugh a little
Or else just a bit, bit, bit, bit
Smile a bit
Hey Aditi laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Laugh a little
Or else just a bit, bit, bit, bit
Smile a bit
Hey Aditi laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Laugh a little
Or else just a bit, bit, bit, bit
Smile a bit"
