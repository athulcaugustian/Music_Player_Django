Half Girlfriend,2,"I search for myself
in your face.
between my eyes,
you are there in such a way,
that there is no place for even dreams.

this rain of this weather,
this rain-water,
these drops of water,
they look for you only.
this wish to meet,
this old with,
with you only, this story of mine
gets completed.

if I get to descend through you,
I'd pass through your breaths,
then, my heart will be at peace.

I'm without a shelter,
I have to find a refuge
in you, allow me.
there is nobody between us,
only the two of us are there,
then why are there distances,
tell me.
I ask the winds
for your address,
now come, from somewhere.
like birds,
this heart is travelling,
make it meet life.
I have just this one request,
once come and know
what this heart has said."
Kabir Singh,7,"Even when I'm not thinking, I think of you.
Why must we separate, this thought troubles me.
The joy of your closeness was unlimited,
even the distances from you turned out to be unprecedented.

now that I'm far from you,
why should I stay away?
I'm your pride,
come, end this distance between us.
you met me like some dream.
Why should I break this dream?

Even when I'm not thinking, I think of you.
Why you gave me the pain of separation, this question comes up.
I got a little angry with myself,
I am a little upset with you for no reason too.

The torture, the trouble is —
how do I live without you?
I have a problem with everyone,
why do they try to become my gods.

These people around me,
they are a forest fire.
Why should I burn in this fire?
They are failures in love,
happy in their loss.
Why should I become like them?

Nights will tell,
In sleeps, I think of you alone.
How do I forget you,
You're with me in my thoughts.

Even when I'm not thinking, I think of you.
Why must we separate, this thought troubles me.

Every scenery is melting like sand
in front of my eyes.
your pain is going down into my body
like some poison.

Come, O world, try me, I don't get upset.
This courage isn't affected by separation.
Neither did she become unfaithful, nor am I one.
She isn't something that can be changed, just like my habits."
Kabir Singh,8,"My eyes are saying what’s there in my heart
I swear that I’m saying the truth

I won’t take a single breath without you
I’ve started to love you a lot
I won’t take a single breath without you
I’ve started to love you a lot
I’ll die along with you
I’ve started to love you a lot

My eyes are saying what’s there in my heart
I swear that I’m saying the truth

I won’t take a single breath without you
I’ve started to love you a lot
I’ll die along with you
I’ve started to love you a lot
I’ve started to love you a lot

Now my desires for you have reached to such an extent
That I’ll snatch you from this world
I have the right to your love
I’ve even declared this to my god
I won’t step on the path where I won’t find you

I won’t take a single breath without you
I’ve started to love you a lot
I’ll die along with you
I’ve started to love you a lot
I’ve started to love you a lot
O o o … o o o … o o o

The Ocean,13,"You can be my guiding light
Keep me
Company in the night

Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic

Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest

And I'll be right here with you 'til end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
(I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)

Hindi Album,29,"He Didn’t Even Touched Me,
Nothing Happened Between Us
When My Loved One Saw Me,
I Started Blushing, Oh My Dear
I Started Blushing
I Started Blushing
Hey Girl, Will You Go With Me
Will You Fill The Glass Having In My Hand, As It Empty
Will You Be Afraid Of The Boy, Who Comes Along With Me?
Will You Fight With The Inner Feeling?
The Limit Has Been Exceeded
Hey Girl, Will You Go Beyond The Limit?
Farm In 9 Acres, Horses In The Farm
Hey Girl, Will You Ride The Horse
1-2-3, Angels Came Out From The Bonnet Of The Car
No One (Boy) Can Stand In Front Of You
My Words Are Crooked, Write It Somewhere
Let’s Go Somewhere
I Am Lost, Like Never Before
The Time When My Eyes Met With Your Eyes, I Haven’t Even Slept
I Have Heard About You From The World
Don’t Know What Will Come In My Part
I Became Addicted To This Thought
When My Loved One Saw Me,
Oh My Dear, I Started Blushing
I Started Blushing
My Status Is Not Good, I Do Wrong Deed
Every Week My Name Appeaers In The News
From Wherever I Pass,
Screams Cames Out From Each Girl
Hold My Hands But Don’t Try To Love Me
What You Say Just Do It
Heard Somewhere,
That You Have Feelings For Me
If Yes, Just Confess It
Just Leave It, Don’t Try To Say Anything
Let The Eyes Say What They Want To Say
Today You Worked So Hard,
Lets Flow All That Like The Water
Eyes Were Sharp, There Was Restlessness
Something Happened When Our Eyes Me
When My Loved One Saw Like That."
